# The projects listed above are from the UW-Madison CS559 (Computer Graphics) Class. The succeeding projects become more complex as we pile on features grounded upon previous weeks. These projects illustrate the integration of Canvas transformations to shaders/textures via WebGL and everything in between.

# Short demos (< 1 min) of each project are in their respective folders. Enjoy!
